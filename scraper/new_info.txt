    Well, i might as well try to put a 2/1 in position to be chosen in the last few odd slots then.



Dammit, the count wasn't up-to-date. Guess I'm going to retract on this post then.

    Hey KCF, that Boom Boom Rocket song is ineligible, so you've got another nom.


I should probably mention that I am almost 100% positive that my Mercury Hg song from Sugar Jesus was made specifically for the game, but there's a small possibility that it isn't. My research led me to believe it was made for the game, which is why I ended up nominating it.

Also, I wasn't paying attention and didn't realize that the original nominator for something I was supporting misspelled it. "Correcting" it to match the formatting.

Nominations are now closed!

As I said before, this is not the final tally. I am going to go over everyone's individual noms and make sure the tally is accurate. I will let everyone know when I'm done with this. Then we can do some sort of public announcement of the cuts. Then the bracketmaking can begin!

Thanks to everyone who nominated and followed the script format; this was a huge timesaver. Special thanks to newbie for basically being my personal hero.
